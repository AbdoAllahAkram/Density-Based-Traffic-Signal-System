# Density-Based-Traffic-Signal-System Using Mircocontroller

Nowadays, controlling traffic is a major issue because of the rapid increase in automobiles
and large time delays between traffic lights. In order to rectify this problem, we will go for
density based traffic lights system. uses IR sensors to measure traffic density. We have to arrange one IR
sensor for each road; these sensors always sense the traffic on that particular road. All these
sensors are interfaced to the microcontroller. Based on these sensors, the controller detects
the traffic and manages the traffic system.
